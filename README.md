# Productivity-Tracker-App
We built a productivity app with login, home, calendar, to-do list, expenses, journal, study tracker, custom projects, and profile editing. 10 of us were working on it.

1. Login Page
The sign-in process is initiated by navigating to the login page, where users are prompted to enter their username and password. A user database is created to manage user credentials. For current users, access to the 'Home page' is granted by entering the correct username and password, followed by password verification. New users are guided to register through the 'Sign up' option. During registration, a form is completed with the necessary information. Upon successful registration, users are enabled to sign in to the application using the entered username and password.
