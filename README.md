# Productivity-Tracker-App
We built a productivity app with login, home, calendar, to-do list, expenses, journal, study tracker, custom projects, and profile editing. 10 of us were working on it.

1. Login Page
   
The sign-in process is initiated by navigating to the login page, where users are prompted to enter their username and password. A user database is created to manage user credentials. For current users, access to the 'Home page' is granted by entering the correct username and password, followed by password verification. New users are guided to register through the 'Sign up' option. During registration, a form is completed with the necessary information. Upon successful registration, users are enabled to sign in to the application using the entered username and password.

2. Home Page
   
After the password is verified, access is granted to the Home Page, where a variety of features can be accessed through buttons. These features, including 'Calendar,' 'Expense Tracker,' 'Study Tracker,' 'Edit Profile,' 'To-Do List,' 'Journal,' 'Custom Project,' and "Login Page" can be navigated by the user with ease.

3. Calendar and Digital Clock

The "Calendar with Digital Clock" feature is designed to offer users a visual representation of a calendar alongside a digital clock. This allows users to navigate through months, change years, and view the current date and time. When the 'Calendar' button on the Home Page is clicked, the calendar along with a digital clock displaying the current time will be displayed. The previous months can be accessed by pressing the '<' button next to the month name, while the '>' button on the other side allows navigation to the next month. Users can select a desired year from the 'Change year' drop-down box.

4. To-Do List

Through the To-do list feature, the user can plan their work. They can list the activities and tick them off once completed. They can insert as many activities as possible here and remove all the activities that are marked as complete at once. Once the 'To Do List' button is opened from the Home Page, then you are directed to the 'To Do List' window. Then you can press the 'Add Task' button to add as many tasks as possible. Added tasks are displayed in red. Once the task is done you can click the 'Done' button at the end of each task. Once you click ‘Done’ the tasks turn green. You can remove the completed tasks by clicking the button 'Clear finished tasks'. Once this is done the remaining tasks are only displayed on the list. If you need to go to the Home Page, click the 'Exit' button at the end of the page.

It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to input details of their expenses, view recorded expenses, and edit existing entries.
